Insider Threat Investigation & Data Visualization

Overview

This project focuses on analyzing diverse data sources, including network logs, employee access records, and email communications, to detect anomalous or suspicious behavior in the context of a potential insider threat investigation. The goal is to identify insider threats while maintaining privacy, ethical standards, and transparency.

Additionally, the project includes a data visualization demonstrating an approach to representing web traffic trends across different sources over time.

Approach

Data Analysis: Investigate security logs, access records, and email activity for unusual patterns.

Privacy Considerations: Ensure compliance with ethical guidelines while analyzing sensitive data.

Transparency & Communication: Present findings effectively to technical and non-technical stakeholders.

Visualization: Use Chart.js to represent web traffic trends in an interactive bar chart.


Technologies Used

Python (for data analysis)

Chart.js (for visualization)

HTML, CSS, and JavaScript


How to Use

1. For Security Analysis: Apply data science techniques to detect anomalies in logs and access records.


2. For Visualization: Use the provided Chart.js setup to visualize web traffic trends.
